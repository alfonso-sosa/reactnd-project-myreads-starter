# MyReads Project

This is the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, forked from [MyReads Starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). 

The goal is to display a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.

When a book is on a bookshelf, it has the same state on both the main application page and the search page.
